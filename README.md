## Installing necessary tools
In previous [Repo](https://github.com/JitrZ/Concordium---Setup-Development-Environment), the environment prepared for development. In this Repo
basic steps for writing first concordium smart contract will be taken.

First, cargo-generate tool needs to be installed. During installation, noticed that C++ build tools is necessary too. So need to install that from VS first 
and then run this command to install cargo-generate tool:

`cargo install --locked cargo-generate`

## Generating new project
A new project generated by running this command:

`cargo concordium init`

There is two templates available, NFT and Smart Contract. Smart contract template has been chosen. Then entered the name of the project and description.
By running `type cargo.toml` inside project folder on cmd, shows the configuration and the smart contract is ready:
